# IShowOff
It's like Discord RPC but for Github.

Shows your last programming session details on your Github Profile:

## What does it do?
It displays your recent activity on Github and makes your profile look better than what it looks like right now.

It will also show what you are doing right now on your computer, like editing a specific project or just idling on VSCode for 42 hours (you know who you are). 

I'm developing a vscode plugin to go along with this. I'll update this readme with detailed instructions once I finish with that.
